# Bottimus
Bottimus is a Discord bot designed primarily to help moderate the Fluffy Servers community. Bottimus comes equipped with a wide range of moderation functions, but more importantly, has an innovative and fun gameplay and currency system.

While Event Scheduling and some advanced moderation commands are restricted to Fluffy Servers, all of the games and economy features are open to any server that Bottimus is in.

## Economy
Users can collect coins in various ways and then spend them on exciting collectable prizes.
By playing various games, such as Hangman, Trivia, and Typeracer, users collect coins.

Users also get a daily spin each day for a sizeable amount of coins

Once users collect 1000 coins, they can exchange it for a chance at a rare prize!

## Event Scheduling
In Fluffy Servers, Bottimus is used to manage community events. Trusted users are able to request events, which are then confirmed by staff members. Other users can then subscribe to event notifications for an alert when the event starts.

Events can also be viewed in a monthly calendar format.

## Moderation
Bottimus also has support for role management. This system is designed to be powerful and modular, allowing for all sorts of combinations of roles to be chosen by users.

Bottimus has muting functionality which can be used to temporarily remove all roles from a user and banish them to a restricted channel. In a similar vein, there is also a ticketing functionality which temporarily grants access to a role.
